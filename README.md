# AssemblyOps

AssemblyOps is an offline-first mobile application that enables attendant overseers to create schedules, assign posts, track check-ins, and facilitate discreet communication during assemblies—all without requiring continuous internet connectivity. The system syncs when wifi is available and operates fully offline otherwise. An admin web portal allows overseers to manage events and schedules from their desktop, while mobile apps serve both administrators and attendants in the field.
